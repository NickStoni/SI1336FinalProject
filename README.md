## Project title 
Traffic flow in a single and multiple lane highway with overtaking
## Summary
In this project I simulated traffic of a highway with overtakes and lane changes where no accidents on the
road occur. One, two and three lane highways were considered. Furthermore, we studied lane change models used in two different regions:
* EU: Left lane (from driverâ€™s perspective) is the overtaking lane, i.e. the cars only overtake on the
left, and change to the right most available lane after the overtake.
* NA: cars can overtake both on the left and on the right and do not necessarily change lane after the overtake.

We studied how different stochastic models of maximum velocities impacted the traffic flow.
Multiple analyses were employed: we investigated fundamental diagrams, and heat maps showing how many cars pass
through each unit of road.
